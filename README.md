# Portfolio

This repo contains the code for my personal portfolio site implemented with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), which provides static generation and route pre-fetching. The site is hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com) at [www.janetxinli.com](https://www.janetxinli.com) and includes a selection of my personal projects and resume.
